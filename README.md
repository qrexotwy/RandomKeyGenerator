# RandomKeyGenerators

This script provides **two different key generators**. It generates a set number of random keys. Created using **Batch scripting**.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/qrexotwy/RandomKeyGenerator/issues) tab.

## Info
You can easily modify the length of the generated keys by adjusting the code as per your needs.

## About
- **NumKeyGen** generates a key that is **16 characters** long, using numbers.
- **UUIDKeyGen** generates a key in the format of a **UUID** (Universally Unique Identifier).

## Example Outputs
- **UUIDKeyGen**

**Note**: While both key types may appear similar, they serve different purposes. **NumKeyGen** is simpler, while **UUIDKeyGen** adheres to the standard UUID format. This is why the tool is called a "simple keygen."
